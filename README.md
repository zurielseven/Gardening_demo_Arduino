# Gardening_Kit_SOCKER_Teensy
This is a Gardening Kit for use in IKEA Socker greenhouse powered by Teensy 3.2 Microcontroller

 Unfortunately, I am not a programmer by trade but I have coded for years
 This represents my ongoing attempt to port this code from Arduino Uno - 
 a 16 MHz device with an 8-bit AVR ATmega327P processor to a 72 MHz device
 that's 1/5th of the area of the Arduino Uno and 1/8th of the Uno's mass.
